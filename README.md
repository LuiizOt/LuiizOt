### About me
---
My name is Luiz Otávio — a Cartographic and Surveying Engineer who loves turning spatial data into meaningful insights.

🚀 Currently diving deep into a Data Science Bootcamp, where I'm learning to handle everything from data wrangling and visualization to predictive modeling and automation.

💼 I work in R&D, developing geospatial solutions and exploring ways to blend engineering, programming, and data science to solve real-world problems.

🧭 Passionate about GIS, Python, automation, and any project that mixes maps, data, and creativity.

Always learning. Always building. 🌍
